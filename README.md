# Advancing-Cybersecurity-Hybrid-Deep-Learning-for-Malware-Classification-and-Beyond
This repository contains code and resources related to the research paper "Advancing Cybersecurity: Hybrid Deep Learning for Malware Classification and Beyond".

## Introduction

The research focuses on improving malware classification through the implementation of hybrid deep learning models. It explores the effectiveness of these models in both binary and multi-class malware classification tasks. The proposed methodology integrates various deep learning architectures with traditional machine learning models, enhancing the classification accuracy and robustness.

## Dataset
Datasets used in the research are Malimg and Windows PE malware for multiclass and binary classification, respectively. Windows PE malware dataset records the API calls made while running each malware sample, offering significant insights on the functionality of the virus. The malimg dataset [20] consists of a wide range of malware samples, organized into 25 classes according to their
families or categories. Each instance in the set is linked to graphical representations, such grayscale images, that are taken from the corresponding malicious file.
