# Advancing-Cybersecurity-Hybrid-Deep-Learning-for-Malware-Classification-and-Beyond
This repository contains code and resources related to the research paper "Advancing Cybersecurity: Hybrid Deep Learning for Malware Classification and Beyond".

## Introduction

The research focuses on improving malware classification through the implementation of hybrid deep learning models. It explores the effectiveness of these models in both binary and multi-class malware classification tasks. The proposed methodology integrates various deep learning architectures with traditional machine learning models, enhancing the classification accuracy and robustness.

## Dataset
### Sample of the Datasets
Datasets used in the research are Malimg [1] and Windows PE malware [2] for multiclass and binary classification, respectively. Windows PE malware dataset records the API calls made while running each malware sample, offering significant insights on the functionality of the virus. The malimg dataset consists of a wide range of malware samples, organized into 25 classes according to their
families or categories. Each instance in the set is linked to graphical representations, such grayscale images, that are taken from the corresponding malicious file.

### Distribution of the classes
The datasets used in this study, namely Malimg and Windows PE, are highly imbalanced, with uneven distribution among the different classes.

## Feature extraction

- **Binary classification techniques:**  
  The preprocessing of the Windows PE Malware API sequence dataset involved two primary methodologies. Initially, tokenization was employed to partition malware binaries into structured components, such as opcode/byte sequences, to extract significant attributes. This enabled the recognition of patterns and fundamental characteristics crucial for categorization. Subsequently, normalization was used to standardize feature values throughout the dataset, reducing biases and ensuring compatibility between features.
- **Multiclass classification techniques:**  
  Image processing for the Malimg dataset included scaling, grayscale conversion, and filtering procedures. Resizing malware images was critical to standardize resolution, ensure consistency, and lower computing complexity. Grayscale conversion reduced image complexity by emphasizing pixel intensity instead of color. Filtering methods such as Gaussian blur or median filtering improved image clarity, ensuring relevant and normalized features for experimental image classification models.

## Results
### Comparative analysis
CNN+BiLSTM and XceptionNet+XGB models outperformed other ML and DL techniques for binary and multiclass malware classification, respectively.
